#### Success Scale

* 1 = Fantastic Trip
* 2 = Good Trip
* 3 = Could be better
* 4 = Not that good
* 5 = total Disaster


1 -> Everything goes exactly to plan, no delays or problems. Everything was
perfect.

weather

3 -> Did everything we wanted but some things went wrong (fair amount of delays,
or bad weather)

4 -> Couldn't do some stuff because of delays or weather or some other reason

5 -> worst case scenario

### Section C


#### Direct

|     Risk     | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Exposure |
|:------------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------------:|
|   Get Lost   |      3     |    2   |       6       |
|     Late     |      2     |    3   |       6       |


##### Get Lost

Our Trip will not be a complete success if we get lost in San Francisco. Given
that it is a foreign city I have given it a 3 for likelihood, but only a 2 for
impact because I think it is more likely that getting lost will result in a
small detour and not a major loss of a day, or missing an event.

##### Late

Our trip will not be a complete success if we are late for either a flight, or
an event. I have rated the likelihood of being late as a 2 because we can
mitigate this risk quite easily. The Impact is a 3, because if we are late it
will quite significantly impact the trip.


#### Indirect

|     Risk     | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Exposure |
|:------------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------------:|
|    Weather   |      2     |    3   |       6       |
|  Earthquake  |      1     |    4   |       4       |
| Plane Delays |      4     |    1   |       4       |


##### Weather

Our Trip will not be a complete success if we hit some bad weather. Luckily, In
San Francisco the weather is usually quite good, so the likelihood is a 2.
Impact is a 3, since for some events like baseball games, bad weather would make
that day somewhat miserable.

##### Earthquake

Our Trip will not be a complete success if there is an earthquake. San Francisco
is known to get earthquakes so it is not impossible to happen, but it is
unlikely, so I gave it a 1. If one did occur though, it would have a major
impact on the trip.

##### Plane Delays

Our trip will not be a complete success if we have some plane delays. Plane
delays in my experience happen quite often, so I gave it a 4. However, since we
have nothing planned on the travel days, it will have no impact.
